## :telescope: Usage
When the user arrives on the website they have the option to search for a character in the search bar or choose from a list of popular characters at the bottom of the page. To launch a search, type in the name of a character and click the search icon or hit 'enter'. The page will populate with the character's name and thumbnail as well as a count of the comics, series, stories and events they appear in. 

A gif relevant to the character, and a brief description is also displayed. The same functionality occurs when a user selects an option from the 'Popular Characters' list. 

Once searched, the character will appear in the favorites dropdown menu for future reference. On smaller devices, Popular Characters can be swiped from a side bar on the lefthand side. Searches are stored locally for improved performance and to avoid API calls.
